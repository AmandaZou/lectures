# Lectures
This repository holds the lecture notes for the class.  Be aware that I may 
update the lecture notes after they are posted.  Periodically check the most recent commit date and comment to see if you have the most recent version. A better strategy would be the use github to update your local version of the
repository (e.g. git clone the repository and then update it with git pull).

# Class Schedule
I will try to keep this updated as to the notes/slides we cover
for each day:

Date    | Slides
--------|--------
Aug. 26 | We went over the syllabus and gave a high level overview of what the course will entail.  Additionally, we defined some common terms/concepts that will be used throughout the course.
Aug. 28 | We talked extensively about R, Rstudio, and R markdown, exploring the styleGuide and beginning to look at the introFlightExample
Aug. 30 | We continued looking at the introFlightExample file and the split-apply-combine paradigm as implemented in the Tidyverse
Sep. 02 | We started Chapter 3 in APM.  We looked at the topics in chapters 3.1 and 3.2
Sep. 04 | We finished looking at Chapter 3 in APM, though we will defer the discussion of dummy variables a bit.
Sep. 06 | We discussed the ideas behind data splitting and resampling.  We gave a thorough discussion of the bootstrap
Sep. 09 | We covered the implementation of R of data splitting and resampling given by the package caret
Sep. 11 | Gave a brief overview of parallelism.  Started discussing how to judge performance in regression models
Sep. 13 | Continued our discussion of judging performance, this time with classification models
Sep. 16 | We covered sensitivity/specificity/precision/recall and adjusting the probability threshold for turning probability estimates into classifications
Sep. 18 | We covered ROC and AUC and adjusting the probability threshold
Sep. 20 | We talked about an multiple linear regression
Sep. 23 | In class workshop on multiple linear regression
